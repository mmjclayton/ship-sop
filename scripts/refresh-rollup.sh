# Refresh the ## Recent Work (rollup) section from docs/recent-work/.
#
# The rollup lives in docs/RECENT-WORK.md in this repo (moved out of CLAUDE.md
# on 2026-08-03 so it stops consuming context every session) and in CLAUDE.md in
# projects that have not migrated. The target is resolved at run time rather
# than hardcoded, so both layouts work without a flag day for consumers.
#
# Idempotent: given identical directory contents, produces identical output.
# That property is load-bearing for parallel-session merges — two agents
# running this in separate worktrees with the same directory state write
# byte-identical rollups, so post-merge regeneration always converges.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/refresh-rollup.sh [rollup-file] [recent-work-dir]
#
# Called by /update-sop Step 6 and /migrate-to-multi-agent Step 9.
#
# Why this lives in a script rather than inline in the slash commands:
# the inline form used `local var=$(cmd)` inside a `{ ... } > output`
# compound group, which under zsh (macOS default) leaks the `var=...`
# assignment lines to stdout and corrupts the target file. Bash handles it
# correctly. Shipping as a script with a bash shebang forces the right
# interpreter regardless of the caller's shell.

# docs/RECENT-WORK.md when it carries the sentinel — creating that file is a
# deliberate migration signal — and fall back to CLAUDE.md, which is where

# List this project's secondary tracker files.
#
# A secondary tracker is any `.md` path named in CLAUDE.md's Key Documents &
# Dispatch table whose headings carry a Backlog-style status tag — audit
# findings, security scans, compliance checklists, migration punch-lists.
# `Backlog.md` and `docs/backlog-archive.md` are excluded; Step 3 covers them.
#
# Emits one bare path per line. Empty output means the project has no secondary
# trackers, which is a normal state and exits 0 — not an error.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/detect-trackers.sh [claude-md-path]
#
# Called by /update-sop Step 4 (reconciliation; formerly Steps 3b and 11, the reconciliation
# hard block).
#
# Why this lives in a script rather than inline in the slash command: those two
# steps run in separate bash blocks, so a function defined in one block does not
# survive to another. The old Step 11 called `detect_trackers` with no definition
# anywhere in the repo, so its `exit 1` hard block could never fire — the loop
# body was unreachable. One definition, two callers, no drift.

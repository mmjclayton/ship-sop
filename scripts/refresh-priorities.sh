# Regenerate the Current Priority Items block in CLAUDE.md from Backlog.md.
#
# Why derived rather than hand-maintained: CLAUDE.md declares Backlog.md the
# single source of truth for work item status, then kept a second hand-written
# copy of the open items beside it. That is a Rule 2 violation shipped in the
# template, and it drifted in every project that used it — worst observed case
# 117 days stale, and agent-sop's own copy drifted inside a single session.
#
# The fix is the pattern this repo already proves with the Recent Work rollup:
# sentinel markers plus a regenerating script. A derived view does not drift,
# because nobody maintains it. This keeps the benefit the pointer alternative
# throws away — the agent sees priorities without grepping Backlog.md — while
# removing the copy that goes stale (P92).
#
# Idempotent: identical Backlog.md contents produce identical output, so
# parallel agents regenerating in separate worktrees converge on merge.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/refresh-priorities.sh [claude-md] [backlog]
#
# Called by /update-sop Step 3 after Backlog.md is updated.
#
# Opt-in: a project whose CLAUDE.md has no sentinel block is left untouched and
# exits 0. Adding the block is what enables the derivation.

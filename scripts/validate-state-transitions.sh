# Validate Backlog.md state-tag transitions against the allowed graph.
#
# Runs at /update-sop Step 2c. Rejects illegal transitions like [OPEN] →
# [SHIPPED] with no [IN PROGRESS] intermediate, terminal-state revivals,
# and [SHIPPED] Feature/Refactor entries with no review citation. Exit code:
# 0 if all transitions legal, 1 if any illegal.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/validate-state-transitions.sh
#     Default: compares HEAD's Backlog.md against working tree. Validates
#     exactly the changes /update-sop is about to commit. No-ops when there
#     is no working-tree diff (nothing to validate).
#
#   bash scripts/validate-state-transitions.sh --before <ref>
#     Compares working-tree Backlog.md against <ref>:Backlog.md. Use with
#     merge-base to replay a whole session's transitions.
#
#   bash scripts/validate-state-transitions.sh --before-file <path> --after-file <path>
#     Fixture mode — no git required. Used by the test harness.
#
#   bash scripts/validate-state-transitions.sh --assert-review <path>
#     P44 substance-assertion helper. Checks a review artifact file has
#     the three required sections (diff summary, severity, finding).
#
#   bash scripts/validate-state-transitions.sh --check-replication
#     P75 replication gate. Intersects this session's changed files with the
#     baseline_shas manifest in agent-sop.config.json. For each hit under
#     .claude/, compares the repo file against its user-scope mirror — the
#     copy that actually executes. Upstream only, also reports stale baseline
#     SHAs. Silent no-op when the session touched no manifest file.
#
# Zero-dependency bash 3.2 (macOS default). No associative arrays.

# ── Review trigger (b): SOP self-modification ────────────────────────────────
#
# claude-agent-sop.md states this as the SOP's one unconditional gate: edits to
# files the SOP itself executes or instructs are load-bearing "regardless of
# LOC". Until P87 that sentence had no execution arm anywhere — update-sop.md
# implemented the diff-size trigger only, and this validator did no path
# inspection at all, so the strongest-sounding gate in the SOP was satisfiable
# by a self-declared `docs-only` token that no code verified.
#
# Tag-independent, deliberately. The tag exemption is the larger hole: the two
# sessions that most needed review on these paths (P75, and this session's own
# P84/P92 work) were tagged [Bug]/[Refactor] and exempt, and the reviews that
# did run found a HIGH and two CRITICALs. Tag is a poor proxy for risk here.

# Claude Code Agent SOP
**Standard Operating Procedure — All Projects**
Last updated: 2026-04-19

## Section 0: Non-Negotiable Rules

These six rules override everything else in this document. Read them first. Apply them without exception.

**Rule 1 — Never delete without a trace. Never add without reason.**
*Prevents: lost history from silent removals, and unjustified code or content creeping in unnoticed.*

No agent may silently remove content from any project document. In-place updates are expected and necessary — changing a status tag, folding an answered question into an item body, correcting an error. The rule is about preserving history, not preventing edits.

**Every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.** If you can't justify a line by pointing to the request that asked for it, delete it. No drive-by refactors, no speculative abstractions, no "while I'm here" additions.

How this works:
- Decisions, gotchas, preferences: append new entries, dated. Mark old ones `[SUPERSEDED - YYYY-MM-DD: reason]` and move to `## Archived`.
- In-flight work: when work completes, move the entry to `## Completed Work`.
- Backlog items: update status tags and item bodies in place. Never remove the item.
- Build plans: append to Batch Log. Mark locked decisions `[LOCKED]`. Never rewrite existing log entries.
- Priority lists: append new items, move deprioritised items to `## Deprioritised`. Never remove.
- project_resume.md: overwrite each session — this is a snapshot, not a log. Historical context belongs in build-plan batch logs.
- Memory files: mark stale files `Status: Superseded - YYYY-MM-DD`. Never delete the file.

Git history is the backstop for in-repo files, but documents must remain human-readable records without requiring a git dig.

**Rule 2 — One source of truth per information type.**
*Prevents: drift and contradiction from duplicated facts; wasted debugging chasing stale copies.*

Information lives in exactly one file. Never duplicate it. When files disagree, resolve using this precedence order:

1. **Code and git state** — what the code actually does and what git shows always wins
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — authoritative for project-specific rules and conventions
3. **`Backlog.md`** — authoritative for work item status
4. **`docs/build-plans/phase-N.md`** — authoritative for phase architecture and decisions
5. **`docs/feature-map.md`** — authoritative for shipped feature inventory
6. **`docs/agent-memory.md`** — cross-session context (decisions, gotchas, invariants)
7. **`project_resume.md`** — lowest precedence, point-in-time snapshot only

If `agent-memory.md` contradicts the code, the code wins — update the memory. If `feature-map.md` is stale relative to `Backlog.md`, trust the Backlog and update the feature map.

**Rule 3 — No opinion. State facts.**
*Prevents: subjective choices disguised as recommendations nudging the user toward decisions they didn't make.*

Respond with evidence — what the code does, what the docs say, what git shows, what tests verify. Do not volunteer opinions, preferences, subjective recommendations, or hedged framing ("probably", "I think", "it might be better to"). If evidence is missing or ambiguous, say so plainly rather than filling the gap with a guess. Offer an opinion only when the user explicitly asks for one ("what do you think", "which would you prefer", "recommend").

How this works:
- Questions about the project: answer from the files, git history, or tests. Cite the source.
- Comparisons between options: present each option's properties as facts. Let the user choose.
- Unknowns: say "I don't know" or "the code doesn't specify" rather than guessing.
- Exception: when explicitly asked for a recommendation, give one — but lead with the evidence and mark the opinion as opinion.

**Rule 4 — Work back and forth before writing any plan.**
*Prevents: committing to the wrong direction before the user sees it; wasted plan work from misread goals.*

Before drafting a plan — feature plan, refactor plan, migration plan, build-plan batch, or any structured proposal — surface open questions and a rough outline first. Wait for the user's response. Iterate. Only write the formal plan once the open questions are resolved.

How this works:
- Start every planning task with: (a) what you understand the goal to be, (b) open questions, (c) a rough outline of approach.
- Do not write step-by-step plans, file lists, or task breakdowns in the first response.
- Wait for answers. If the user corrects the goal or outline, incorporate and re-check before committing to a plan.
- Exception: trivial changes (one-line fix, typo, rename) do not need a plan at all and are not covered by this rule.

**Rule 5 — Instruction budget: ≤150 soft cap, 200 hard ceiling.**
*Prevents: instruction drop-out, contradiction, and diluted attention past ~200 items.*

Any agent — primary, subagent, or custom — must operate under a total of ≤150 distinct instructions across its combined context (this SOP, `CLAUDE.md`, agent definition files, rules files under `~/.claude/rules/`, and the invocation prompt). 200 is the absolute ceiling. Past that, instructions drop, contradict, or dilute attention.

How to count: each distinct directive counts as one — numbered rules, checklist items, "always/never/must/must-not" statements, and table rows defining required behaviour. Narrative prose, examples, code blocks, and section headings do not count.

How to stay under: trim before adding. Every new instruction must identify what it supersedes or why the net count is still under budget. When an agent approaches 150, consolidate overlapping rules or move reference material out of the instruction surface (into examples, guides, or linked references).

**Rule 6 — Surface interpretations before acting.**
*Prevents: hidden interpretation picks surfacing later as rework.*

When a request has multiple valid interpretations — ambiguous scope, target, or output — list the interpretations, name the one you'd default to, and ask. Do not pick silently. Exception: trivial reversible choices (variable naming in a one-liner) — pick and note the choice rather than stalling.

**Override hierarchy:** `CLAUDE.md` can override any project-specific convention defined in this SOP (tag taxonomy, file paths, stack-specific rules). It cannot override the six non-negotiable rules above. They apply to every project regardless of what CLAUDE.md says.

**Multi-agent parallel sessions:** Multiple agents on the same project work in separate git worktrees on separate branches. Tracking-file conflicts are prevented by structural choices — no human-in-the-loop co-ordination required:
- **Per-entry directories:** Recent Work, Decisions, and Gotchas live as one file per entry with agent-id in the filename. Two agents writing on the same date produce distinct filenames. The CLAUDE.md `## Recent Work (rollup)` section is derived from `docs/recent-work/` via `/update-sop` Step 8b; regeneration is idempotent so merges converge.
- **Per-agent resume snapshots:** `project_resume_<agent-id>.md` keyed by agent-id. No cross-agent clobber.
- **Commit-range partitioning:** secondary-tracker reconciliation, drift guard, and hard-block checks use `git merge-base <default> HEAD..HEAD` so sibling agents' finding IDs never contaminate this agent's scope.
- **P-number collision detection:** `/update-sop` Step 2a hard-blocks when two agents independently pick the same P-number; resolved via the `renumber_p` helper.
- **Code files:** worktrees typically give each agent a mutually exclusive file set. When code conflicts do arise, the agent merging second reads both versions and produces a correct merge; flag non-trivial cases in a new `docs/agent-memory/gotchas/` entry.

See `docs/guides/multi-agent-parallel-sessions.md` for the full mechanics, agent-id resolution, `renumber_p` helper, and dogfood protocol.

## Purpose

This SOP defines the standard file structure, naming conventions, update rules, and session checklists that all Claude Code agents must follow across every project. Consistent implementation means agents start every session with full context, never duplicate information, and leave every session in a state the next agent can pick up immediately.

---

## 1. Standard File Set

Every project must have the following files. Create them at project initialisation. Never rename or move them.

### In-repo files (committed to git)

| File | Path | Owner | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | Human + Agent | Stack, conventions, dispatch reference, rules. Master context file. |
| Backlog | `Backlog.md` | Human + Agent | Single source of truth for all work items. |
| Agent memory | `docs/agent-memory.md` | Agent | Cross-session narrative: In-Flight Work, Completed Work, Preferences, Archived. Decisions and Gotchas live in per-entry directories (see below). Read and updated every session. **Optional for projects with fewer than 10 sessions.** |
| Decisions | `docs/agent-memory/decisions/` | Agent | One file per decision. Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_<agent-id>_<slug>.md`. Enables parallel agents to append without merge conflicts. |
| Gotchas | `docs/agent-memory/gotchas/` | Agent | One file per gotcha. Same filename convention as decisions. |
| Recent Work entries | `docs/recent-work/` | Agent | One file per session summary. Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_<agent-id>_<slug>.md`. CLAUDE.md `## Recent Work (rollup)` section is a derived summary of this directory. |
| Feature map | `docs/feature-map.md` | Agent | Inventory of shipped features and prioritised roadmap. |
| Build plans | `docs/build-plans/phase-N-[name].md` | Agent | Phase-level architecture, batch logs, deploy checklists. One file per phase. |

### Optional in-repo files (create when relevant)

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Brand voice | `.claude/brand-voice.md` | Copy rules, tone, terminology. Required for any project with user-facing text. |
| Other AI config | `.claude/[name].md` | Project-specific guidance for agents that doesn't belong in CLAUDE.md. |

### Machine-local files (not committed)

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Auto-memory index | `~/.claude/projects/[project-hash]/memory/MEMORY.md` | Index of all memory files. Maintained automatically. |
| Memory files | `~/.claude/projects/[project-hash]/memory/[type]_[topic].md` | Individual memory entries. Types: `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`. |
| Resume point (per-agent) | `~/.claude/projects/[project-hash]/memory/project_resume_<agent-id>.md` | Per-session handoff: what was done, what is next, any blockers. Overwritten every session end. `solo` agent uses `project_resume_solo.md` (or legacy `project_resume.md` — `/restart-sop` falls back when present). See `docs/guides/multi-agent-parallel-sessions.md`. |

**Two memory systems — clear separation:**
Claude Code has two memory systems. They serve different purposes and must not overlap:

| System | Location | What belongs here | Committed to git? |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `docs/agent-memory.md` | In-repo | Facts any contributor needs: architectural decisions, data model invariants, gotchas, named utility functions, project preferences | Yes |
| Auto-memory (`~/.claude/.../memory/`) | Local machine | User-specific preferences, session state, personal workflow notes, feedback on agent behaviour | No |

**Rule of thumb:** if a different developer (or a different machine) would need this information, it goes in `docs/agent-memory.md`. If it is about how *this user* prefers to work, it goes in auto-memory.

**Reliability warning:** Auto-memory recall is unreliable — stored rules are frequently not applied in subsequent sessions (multiple confirmed community reports as of 2026). `docs/agent-memory.md` is the authoritative cross-session context source. Never store project-critical information only in auto-memory.

**Filename rule:** The resume file is named `project_resume_<agent-id>.md`, where `<agent-id>` is resolved per `docs/guides/multi-agent-parallel-sessions.md` Section 1. Single-agent projects produce `project_resume_solo.md`. Legacy projects with an unsuffixed `project_resume.md` remain supported — `/restart-sop` falls back to it when `project_resume_<agent-id>.md` is absent.

**Distinction:** `docs/agent-memory.md` is permanent cross-session context (architectural decisions, data model invariants, named utility functions, patterns) — committed to git, visible to all contributors. `project_resume.md` is a point-in-time snapshot (where the project stands, what is next) — local, overwritten each session. Different purpose, different audience. Never confuse them.

**API primitive:** The Claude API `memory_20250818` tool is the underlying mechanism for file-backed persistent notes. The SOP's `docs/agent-memory.md` is the manual, git-committed equivalent. When using tool-result clearing, always exclude the memory tool from clearing — see `docs/sop/harness-configuration.md`. For Managed Agents API integration, see `docs/guides/managed-agents-integration.md` (deferred, P33).

## 2. File Ownership Rules

| Information type | Lives in | Never in |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Work item status | `Backlog.md` | Build plans, agent-memory.md |
| Phase architecture and decisions | `docs/build-plans/phase-N.md` | CLAUDE.md, agent-memory.md |
| Shipped feature inventory | `docs/feature-map.md` | CLAUDE.md |
| Stack, conventions, hard rules | `CLAUDE.md` | agent-memory.md |
| Cross-session decisions, gotchas, invariants | `docs/agent-memory.md` | CLAUDE.md |
| Per-session handoff | `project_resume.md` (local) | Any in-repo file |
| Brand and copy rules | `.claude/brand-voice.md` | CLAUDE.md, agent-memory.md |
| Long-term feedback and preferences | `~/.claude/memory/` files | In-repo files |

## Deprioritised
[Items moved here from priority lists. Never removed from this section.]
```

### docs/agent-memory.md

`docs/agent-memory.md` holds the narrative sections (In-Flight Work, Completed Work, Preferences, Archived). **Decisions and Gotchas live in per-entry directories** at `docs/agent-memory/decisions/` and `docs/agent-memory/gotchas/` — one file per entry, with `YYYY-MM-DD_<agent-id>_<slug>.md` filenames. This removes the merge-conflict surface for concurrent appends.

```
# Agent Memory

Shared narrative context for all agents. Decisions and Gotchas live in the
sibling directories `agent-memory/decisions/` and `agent-memory/gotchas/`.
Read this file + scan those directories at the start of every session.

## Key Documents
[Do not duplicate the table from CLAUDE.md. Instead: "See CLAUDE.md Key Documents table."]

## Key Source Files for Current Work
[Table: Area | File | Notes — updated at the start of each phase, not each session]

## In-Flight Work
[Per-agent lines, format: `- <agent-id> (YYYY-MM-DD): description`. Each agent manages their own line. When work completes, the agent moves their line to ## Completed Work. Empty is fine.]

## [Project]'s Preferences
[Agent behaviour preferences for this project. Append only.]

## Completed Work
[Entries moved from In-Flight Work when done. Format: `- YYYY-MM-DD <agent-id>: description — PR #N or commit hash`]

## Archived
[Historical narrative that no longer belongs in active sections. Never delete.]
```

### docs/agent-memory/decisions/

Directory of per-decision entry files. One file per architectural decision, data model invariant, or named-utility callout.

```
docs/agent-memory/decisions/
  2026-04-19_solo_p42-secondary-tracker-reconciliation.md
  2026-04-19_a7c3f2_rollup-derivation-idempotent.md
  archive/                (entries older than 90 days, preserved)
```

**Filename convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD_<agent-id>_<slug>.md`
- `_` is the field separator; `-` is allowed within each field.
- `<agent-id>` must be alphanumeric + hyphens (no underscores). See `docs/guides/multi-agent-parallel-sessions.md` Section 1 for resolution.
- `<slug>` is kebab-case, max ~50 chars, no leading/trailing hyphen.

**File format:**

```
# [Decision title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Agent:** <agent-id>

[Decision body. Multi-paragraph is fine. Reference P-numbers where applicable.]

---
*Supersedes:* [file-name or P-number, if any]
*Superseded by:* [file-name, if later entry replaces this]
```

**Superseded decisions:** do not delete. Add a trailing `*Superseded by:*` line pointing to the replacement file, and move the superseded file to `archive/` once the replacement lands.

### docs/agent-memory/gotchas/

Same structure as decisions, for data model invariants, framework gotchas, and named utility functions agents commonly miss. Same filename convention. Same file format (swap "Decision" for "Gotcha" in the title).

### docs/recent-work/

Directory of per-session entry files. The CLAUDE.md `## Recent Work (rollup)` section is a derived summary of this directory.

```
docs/recent-work/
  2026-04-19_solo_p43-batch-1-2-directory-structure.md
  2026-04-18_a7c3f2_fix-tonnage-edge-case.md
  archive/                (entries older than 90 days, preserved)
```

**Filename convention:** same as decisions.

**File format:**

```
# [Session summary title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Agent:** <agent-id>
**Commits:** [hash, hash, ...] or PRs: [#N, #N, ...]

[2-4 line summary of what shipped. Cross-reference Backlog P-numbers and build-plan batch numbers.]
```

**Template variants:** Two CLAUDE.md templates exist in `docs/templates/`: `claude-md-template-base.md` for any project type (markdown, scripts, docs), and `claude-md-template-code.md` for full-stack code projects (adds Auth, Database, Design System, and code-specific build rules). Always start from the base template and add the code sections only if needed.

**CLAUDE.md size limit:** Keep the per-session sections of CLAUDE.md under 200 lines / 2,000 tokens for non-code projects, or **300 lines / 3,000 tokens for code projects that include a Common Mistakes section** (benchmark data shows the extra ~100 lines for Common Mistakes pays for itself in fewer wrong turns and prevented production bugs). Per-session sections are everything an agent reads every session: Agent SOP, Build Plans, Key Documents, Priority Items, Backlog Management, Key Commands, Common Mistakes, Rules for Automated Builds, Session & Memory Hygiene, Dispatch Quick Reference, and Recent Work. Project-specific reference sections (Auth, Database, Design System, and similar) may extend beyond the target — these are consulted on demand, not read every session, so their context cost is incurred only when relevant. If per-session sections are growing beyond the limit, move detail into `docs/agent-memory.md`, build plans, or source-file comments.

**Token overhead:** Every file read by an agent costs approximately 1.7x its raw token count (loading and processing overhead). This is why the size limit matters and why the Dispatch Quick Reference enforces a minimum rather than a maximum. Keep referenced files lean and targeted. Line-range hints (e.g. "CSS tokens - client/src/index.css lines 1-80") reduce overhead significantly for large files.

**What belongs in Gotchas:** not just lessons from mistakes, but also: data model invariants that aren't obvious from the schema (e.g. "ExerciseCategory is the shared library, Exercise is program-scoped - edits go to taxonomyOverrides"), named utility functions for cross-cutting concerns (e.g. "use displayMuscleGroup() for all muscle group display logic"), and framework-specific patterns that agents commonly get wrong.

**What does NOT belong in agent-memory.md:** derived facts that go stale — test counts, line numbers, file sizes, dependency versions. These are always cheaper to check at runtime than to maintain in a document. Store the *rule* ("always run tests before push") not the *measurement* ("test suite has 847 tests").

### docs/build-plans/phase-N-[name].md

```
# Phase N — [Name]

Status: [emoji] [Planning / In Progress / Shipped YYYY-MM-DD]

## Problem
[What the phase solves]

[Table: Batch | What | Priority]

## Architecture
[Key technical decisions and approach]

## Key Decisions Locked In
[Bullet list marked [LOCKED] — not re-opened without explicit instruction]

## Batch Log

## Deploy Checklist
[Steps to verify before marking the phase shipped]

## Open Questions
[Pending questions. Answered questions stay here, marked [RESOLVED - YYYY-MM-DD: answer]]
```

### project_resume_<agent-id>.md (local, per-agent, overwrite each session)

Snapshot, not a log. Per-agent file — multiple agents on separate worktrees each own their own file. Overwrite the entire content each session. Historical context belongs in build-plan batch logs.

```
# Session Resume — [Project Name] — Agent <agent-id>

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## What was done
[2-4 lines. PR numbers where applicable.]

## What is next
[Specific next action — file, function, or Backlog item.]

## Blockers
[(none) or specific blocker with context]
```

Legacy single-agent projects may still have an unsuffixed `project_resume.md`. `/restart-sop` Step 2 falls back to it when `project_resume_<agent-id>.md` is absent.

---

## 4. Versioning Rules

Per-file versioning rules are defined in Section 0 Rule 1 "How this works". No separate restatement here.

---

## 5. Session Start Checklist

**Every agent, every session, every project. No exceptions.**

**Run `/restart-sop` at the start of every session.** This slash command (installed via `.claude/commands/restart-sop.md`) automates the full checklist below. If the command is not available, execute the steps manually.

```
1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Read MEMORY.md + project_resume.md
3. Read docs/agent-memory.md
4. Run git log --oneline -10, cross-check memory against current file state
5. Read the Backlog item(s) for this session
```

- If In-Flight Work is populated or `project_resume.md` has no What's Next — previous session was interrupted. Read the build plan Batch Log before starting anything new.
- Source files from the Key Source Files table in `agent-memory.md` are read as work begins, not as a checklist ceremony.

**Lightweight start (for small, scoped tasks):**
Tasks tagged `[ok-for-automation]` or single-file changes with fewer than 2 acceptance criteria may use a reduced checklist:
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md (specifically: Common Mistakes + Dispatch sections)
2. Read the Backlog item for this task
```
Skip agent-memory.md, build plans, and MEMORY.md/project_resume.md. The lightweight start saves ~3-4K tokens per session. Use the full checklist for any task that touches multiple files, requires data model knowledge, or involves architectural decisions.

---

## 6. Session End Checklist

**Run `/update-sop` at the end of every session.** This slash command (installed via `.claude/commands/update-sop.md`) automates the full checklist below. If the command is not available, execute the steps manually. Never-delete-without-a-trace applies to every step.

```
1. Run tests (code projects) — fix failures before proceeding
   Step 1b: Reviewer-turn gate. For any [Feature] or [Refactor] shipping this session with diff over threshold (default 50 LOC / 3 files, configurable in agent-sop.config.json), invoke code-reviewer (or security-reviewer for auth/crypto/payment diffs) and require a substantive review artifact at docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_<agent-id>_P<n>.md. Hard-block if missing or fails substance assertion. No human sign-off — agent-to-agent review, validator-enforced.
2. Backlog.md — update status tags in place, append new items (Step 2a: P-number collision check against default branch, hard-block if collision)
3. Secondary trackers — reconcile any project-specific finding lists (audit-backlog-*.md, security-findings.md, compliance-*.md). Commit range partitioned via `git merge-base <default> HEAD..HEAD`. Hard block: if any ID in this session's commits is still [OPEN] in a tracker, reconcile before step 8. Step 3c: state-transition validator hard-blocks illegal tag transitions and [SHIPPED] without Batch Log reference. Step 3d: drift detection hard-blocks over-threshold sessions whose commit messages don't reference any P-number declared in `project_resume_<agent-id>.md` — escape hatch is a `## Scope Change` block in the resume file.
4. docs/feature-map.md — append shipped items
5. docs/agent-memory.md narrative + decisions/gotchas directories — write new decisions to docs/agent-memory/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD_<agent-id>_<slug>.md, new gotchas to docs/agent-memory/gotchas/, update In-Flight/Completed lines in agent-memory.md by agent-id
6. docs/build-plans/phase-N.md — append to Batch Log (must reference review path for [Feature]/[Refactor] items over threshold — Step 3c validator enforces)
7. project_resume_<agent-id>.md — overwrite with current state (snapshot, per-agent)
8. Write session entry to docs/recent-work/ and refresh CLAUDE.md rollup section
9. Commit docs/ changes with the work
```

**Context compaction threshold:** When context reaches approximately 60% capacity, wrap up the current batch and run `/update-sop` (or complete the session end checklist manually) before continuing. Do not push to 95% — compaction at that point causes context loss and unreliable behaviour in the remainder of the session. Treat 60% as the session boundary signal, not a warning to ignore.

---

## 7. Update Triggers

| Trigger | Files to update |
|---------|----------------|
| Feature ships to production | `Backlog.md` (→ SHIPPED), `docs/feature-map.md` |
| Feature verified in production | `Backlog.md` (→ VERIFIED) |
| New work item identified | `Backlog.md` (append with [OPEN]) |
| Work item starts | `Backlog.md` (→ IN PROGRESS), create GitHub issue |
| Architectural decision made | `docs/build-plans/phase-N.md`, `docs/agent-memory.md` |
| Data model invariant or utility function identified | `docs/agent-memory.md` (Gotchas section) |
| Non-obvious lesson learned | `docs/agent-memory.md` (Gotchas section) |
| Phase completes | `docs/build-plans/phase-N.md` (status → Shipped, Batch Log final), `docs/feature-map.md` |
| New phase starts | Create `docs/build-plans/phase-N+1.md`, update CLAUDE.md Build Plans, update Key Source Files in agent-memory.md |
| Stack or convention changes | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Copy or tone rule established | `.claude/brand-voice.md` |
| Key Documents table updated in either CLAUDE.md or agent-memory.md | Update the other file to match. `CLAUDE.md` is authoritative if they conflict. |
| Session ends | `project_resume.md` (overwrite with snapshot), `docs/agent-memory.md` (In-Flight) |

---

## 8. Backlog Tag Taxonomy

**Status (always first, always one):**
- `[OPEN]` - not started
- `[IN PROGRESS]` - active work
- `[BLOCKED]` - waiting on an external action (someone else must do X first)
- `[DEFERRED]` - intentionally postponed with no external blocker (chosen to do later). Distinct from `[BLOCKED]`: blocked means cannot proceed, deferred means chose not to proceed yet. Use `[DEFERRED]` instead of leaving stale `[OPEN]` items that were consciously pushed back.
- `[SHIPPED - YYYY-MM-DD]` - merged to main and deployed
- `[VERIFIED - YYYY-MM-DD]` - confirmed correct in the live environment. For code projects: tested in production. For documentation projects: reviewed by the project owner and confirmed accurate and complete. For other project types: define what verified means in CLAUDE.md.
- `[WON'T]` - decision not to build. Required format: `[WON'T] [Type] — Reason: [one-line explanation or superseding P-number]`

**Type (always second, always one):**
- `[Feature]` - new capability
- `[Iteration]` - improvement to existing capability
- `[Bug]` - something broken
- `[Refactor]` - code quality, no user-visible change

**Optional (can combine, never used alone):**
- `[has-open-questions]` - cannot be automated, needs human input first
- `[ok-for-automation]` - qualifies for the auto-pipeline (see criteria below)

**Automation qualification — all must be true:**
- Small blast radius (one file, component, or route)
- At least 2 concrete acceptance criteria
- Names the specific file/component to change
- No `[has-open-questions]` tag
- Reversible

**Tag order:** Status first. Type second. Optional last. Never reverse.

**Backlog archive threshold:** When `Backlog.md` exceeds approximately 2,000 lines, move all `[SHIPPED]` and `[VERIFIED]` items older than 90 days to a `## Shipped Archive` section at the bottom of the file (or to a separate `docs/backlog-archive.md` if preferred). Items in the archive retain their full content and are never deleted.

**Allowed transitions (validated by `/update-sop` Step 3c):**

| From | Legal next states |
|------|-------------------|
| `<absent>` | `[OPEN]`, `[DEFERRED]`, `[IN PROGRESS]` |
| `[OPEN]` | `[IN PROGRESS]`, `[DEFERRED]`, `[SHIPPED]`, `[WON'T]` |
| `[IN PROGRESS]` | `[BLOCKED]`, `[DEFERRED]`, `[SHIPPED]`, `[WON'T]` |
| `[BLOCKED]` | `[IN PROGRESS]`, `[DEFERRED]`, `[SHIPPED]`, `[WON'T]` |
| `[DEFERRED]` | `[IN PROGRESS]`, `[SHIPPED]`, `[WON'T]`, `[BLOCKED]` |
| `[SHIPPED]` | `[VERIFIED]` |
| `[VERIFIED]` / `[WON'T]` | terminal — revival requires a new P-number |

`[SHIPPED]` transitions (from any legal source) additionally require a Batch Log reference in `docs/build-plans/phase-*.md` — this is the anti-gaming teeth. `<absent>` → `[SHIPPED]` stays illegal so unplanned work cannot ship without leaving a paper trail. `[BLOCKED]` ↔ `[DEFERRED]` soft-warns if no decision file references the P-number in the commit range.

---

## 9. P-Number System

- Assign sequentially. Never reuse a P-number.
- P-numbers do not imply priority — priority is set explicitly in CLAUDE.md.
- Priority tiers: Very High / High / Medium / Low / Won't Build.
- When superseded: mark old item `[WON'T]` and reference the superseding P-number.
- No P-number = operational work (infra, in-session bug fixes, migrations).

---

## 10. Issue Tracker Sync Rules

- Issues are lazy-created: only when an item moves to `[IN PROGRESS]`.
- `Backlog.md` is always authoritative. The issue tracker (GitHub, GitLab, Linear, or equivalent) is downstream.
- Close the issue in the same PR or commit that ships the work.
- Branch naming: `<type>/<short-slug>` — type matches the Backlog type tag.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
- Recent Work entries in CLAUDE.md must include PR or commit reference ranges (e.g. "PRs #65-#94" or "commits abc123-def456"). For documentation-only projects with no PRs, use the commit hash range.
- Projects with no issue tracker: skip issue creation entirely. `Backlog.md` is the only tracker.

---

## 11. Key Documents & Dispatch (Required Section)

Every project's CLAUDE.md must include a Key Documents & Dispatch section. Requirements:

- **Intent-based format required.** Use "When you need to..." column headers, not "Area | File". Benchmark data shows intent-based dispatch reduces tool calls by 50% on complex tasks (agents go directly to the right file instead of exploring). The old "Area | File" format is deprecated.
- Minimum 5 named entry-point files with full relative paths
- Notes column must include contextual guidance (related components, gotchas, constraints)
- Updated at the start of each phase — not just at project setup
- Include line-range hints for large files (e.g. "CSS tokens — client/src/index.css (lines 1-80)")
- Include test command and after-shipping reminder

**Correct format:**
```
| When you need to... | Start at | Notes |
|---------------------|----------|-------|
| Change X | `path/to/file` | Related component is Y. Watch out for Z. |
```

**Deprecated format (do not use):**
```
| Area | File |
|------|------|
| X | `path/to/file` |
```

This section is what allows an agent dropped into the middle of a project to orient in under 2 minutes.

## 12. Optional Patterns for Large Projects

Large-project-only patterns (`claude-progress.txt`, sub-agent delegation, schema-change protocol, continuous learning, outcome rubrics) live in `docs/guides/optional-patterns.md`. Add them when complexity warrants — they are not required for standard projects.

---

## 13. Applying This SOP to a New Project

1. Copy `claude-md-template.md` and fill in project-specific sections.
2. Create `Backlog.md` with the tag taxonomy header and first items.
3. Create `docs/agent-memory.md` with all sections (including empty Completed Work and Archived).
4. Create `docs/feature-map.md` with `Last updated` header and empty Shipped/Roadmap sections.
5. Create `docs/build-plans/phase-0-foundation.md`.
6. Create `.claude/brand-voice.md` if the project has user-facing copy.
7. On first Claude Code session: confirm MEMORY.md path, create `project_resume.md`.

**When to start a new phase:** A new phase begins when the current phase's Deploy Checklist is complete, or when the scope shifts to a meaningfully different set of capabilities or users — even if some items from the previous phase remain open. A rule of thumb: if the next batch of work would require rewriting more than half of the current build plan's Architecture section, it warrants a new phase. Carry-over items from the previous phase are added to the new phase's Scope table rather than re-opened in the old phase file.

**Minimum viable setup for existing projects being migrated:**
1. Audit existing files against the standard file set.
2. Add Completed Work and Archived sections to docs/agent-memory.md.
3. Replace the session checklists in CLAUDE.md with the standard ones from this SOP.
4. Add project_resume.md to the MEMORY.md index if missing.
5. Add line-range hints to the Key Documents table for any file over 200 lines.
6. Verify Dispatch Quick Reference has at least 5 named files and is current.

## 14. Common Mistakes to Avoid

See `docs/guides/sop-common-mistakes.md` for the full table of agent-behaviour mistakes when applying the SOP. These are distinct from the per-project "Common Mistakes — Read Before Coding" template described in Section 15.1.

---

## 15. Benchmark-Proven Practices

*The following practices are backed by A/B benchmark data (SOP vs no-SOP agents on identical tasks). They produced a 33% quality improvement on vague, context-dependent tasks. See `docs/benchmark/results/` for full methodology and data.*

### 15.1 Common Mistakes Section (Required for Code Projects)

Every code project's CLAUDE.md must include a `## Common Mistakes` section with project-specific gotcha callouts. This is the single highest-value section for agent quality — it directly prevented production bugs in benchmark testing.

**Structure the section by area:**

```
## Common Mistakes — Read Before Coding

### Data Model
- [Model X] is GLOBAL. Never filter by userId. [Model Y] is user-scoped.
- [Field] is derived, not stored. Never add a column for it.
- [Table.column] is scoped to [constraint], not globally unique.

### Client
- [Component A] is its own file, not inside [Component B].
- The default view is [view name]. When referring to "home", it is [key].
- [Component] exists at [path]. Check for it before creating a similar one.
- CSS colours must use [token prefix] tokens only. Never hardcode hex.

### Server
- Every query filters by [user field] via [relation]. Never query without it.
- [Utility function] does [thing]. Use it, do not create your own.

### Testing
- Tests use [real DB / mocks]. Test DB is [name].

### Brand Voice
- [One-line summary of tone]. See [path] for full guide.
```

**What makes a good gotcha entry:**
- States what NOT to do and why (negative guidance prevents errors)
- **States what IS correct** (not just the anti-pattern — benchmark data shows agents can misinterpret "don't do X" as "remove the mechanism entirely" without a positive alternative)
- Names specific files, functions, models, or CSS tokens
- Explains the consequence of getting it wrong
- Is discoverable by reading code, but easily missed under time pressure

**Example of a weak entry (anti-pattern only):**
```
Tonnage is derived, not stored. Calculated from weight x reps x countTwice flags.
```

**Example of a strong entry (anti-pattern + correct pattern):**
```
Tonnage is derived, not stored. The bilateral multiplier Math.max(wMult, rMult) is the correct formula — do not remove it. Historical bug (B1) was wMult * rMult (4x) instead of Math.max (2x).
```

The weak entry led a benchmark agent to remove the multiplier entirely. The strong entry prevents that misinterpretation.

**What does NOT belong:**
- General best practices (use the Code Quality Rules section)
- Derived facts that go stale (test counts, line numbers)
- Information already obvious from reading the schema or code

### 15.2 Intent-Rich Dispatch (Required)

The Key Documents & Dispatch section must use **intent-based descriptions**, not just file paths. Agents given "when you need to change X, start at Y" navigate directly to the right files. Agents given only file paths waste tool calls exploring.

**Pattern:**

```
| When you need to... | Start at | Notes |
|---------------------|----------|-------|
| Change workout logging | `WorkoutLogger.jsx` | State machine. ExerciseCard is separate file. |
| Change the data model | `schema.prisma` | Always create a migration. Follow protocol. |
| Change colours/spacing | `index.css` (lines 1-80) | 80+ CSS tokens. Never hardcode hex. |
```

**Compare with the weaker pattern (file-path only):**

```
| Area | File |
|------|------|
| Workout logger | `WorkoutLogger.jsx` |
| Schema | `schema.prisma` |
| CSS | `index.css` |
```

The intent-based version tells the agent what to do when they arrive. The file-path version only tells them where to go.

### 15.3 Vague Prompt Resilience

The SOP should be designed to help agents succeed when prompts are vague and product-level ("fix the tonnage bug", "add skip exercise"), not just when prompts are precise ("modify line 42 of file X"). In benchmarks, precise prompts masked context deficiencies — both SOP and baseline agents scored similarly. Vague prompts exposed a 33% quality gap.

**Implication for CLAUDE.md authors:** write context that answers the questions a developer would ask when handed a vague task:
- "Where does this logic live?" (intent-rich dispatch)
- "What should I NOT do?" (common mistakes)
- "What already exists that I should reuse?" (named components, utilities, tokens)
- "What are the non-obvious constraints?" (data model gotchas, brand voice rules)

### 15.4 Benchmark Safety Rules

When running A/B benchmarks or any agent testing against a real codebase:

- **Never push to main or any shared branch.** Benchmark agents work on throwaway branches in git worktrees only.
- **Never access production or staging databases.** Benchmark agents use test databases or no database.
- **Never deploy.** No CI triggers, no Render/Vercel deploys, no pushing to remote.
- **Clean up after every round.** Remove worktrees and branches when scoring is complete.
- **Run benchmark batches strictly sequentially.** Never overlap agent batches on the same worktrees within a benchmark round. Setup round N, run all agents, wait for completion, score, cleanup, then setup round N+1. Concurrent batches cause worktree contamination in benchmarks.

  This applies to A/B benchmarks specifically. General parallel development work (3-5 agents on independent worktrees shipping different items) is supported — see `docs/guides/multi-agent-parallel-sessions.md`.

**Managed Agents API safety:** when benchmarks run via the Managed Agents API instead of local Claude Code, see `docs/guides/managed-agents-integration.md` (Benchmark safety section) for permission-policy and isolation rules.

## 16. Multi-Agent Context Routing

Applies only when multiple agents work in parallel on the same project. See `docs/guides/multi-agent-context-routing.md` for the context-tier table, routing rules, conflict avoidance, and Managed Agents API mapping.

---

## 17. SOP Evolution Loop

The SOP is a living document. Use benchmark data — not gut feeling — to iteratively improve it: run A/B benchmark, identify what helped/hurt/had no effect, fix and re-run.

See `docs/guides/sop-hill-climbing.md` for the methodology and the five benchmark-proven principles.

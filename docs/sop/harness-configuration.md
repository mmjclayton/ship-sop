# Harness Configuration Reference

Last updated: 2026-04-17

How to configure Claude Code's runtime — hooks and context primitives — to enforce the SOP automatically rather than relying on agent memory. Merges the former `hooks.md` and `context-management.md` on 2026-04-17 as part of the P32 trim.

## Core Rules

1. **Default settings are sufficient for most projects.** The SOP's 60% context threshold and manual checklists work without any harness configuration.
2. **Use hooks for repeatable, mechanical enforcement.** Secret scans, session-start context loading, type checks. Anything that should fire every time, regardless of whether the agent remembered.
3. **Use context primitives (clearing, compaction) only for long sessions.** Clearing: > 30 minutes / 30K tokens of tool results. Compaction: > 60 minutes / 120K tokens.
4. **Always exclude the memory tool from clearing.** Clearing memory tool results destroys the agent's ability to recall what it saved: `exclude_tools: ["memory"]`.
5. **Keep blocking hooks fast.** Under 200ms to avoid degrading the session.
6. **Treat project-scope hooks from cloned repos as untrusted.** Review before use — they execute in your environment. See `docs/sop/security.md`.
7. **Placement:** user-scope hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, project-scope in `.claude/settings.json`.
8. **Combine hooks with checklists, don't replace.** Hooks handle the mechanical; checklists handle judgment.
9. **Hooks must fail open.** A failing hook must never block the Claude Code session. Catch errors, log them, let the session continue. For blocking gates that genuinely must stop a bad action (secret scan, destructive command), fail closed with a clear error message — but add a circuit breaker (e.g. suppress after 3 consecutive failures in the same session) so a broken hook can't strand the agent.

## Hook Types

| Type | When it fires | Use for |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool executes | Blocking gates: secret scanning, lint checks, push review |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool executes | Logging, format checks, type checking |
| `SessionStart` | When a new session begins | Auto-loading context files |
| `SessionEnd` | When a session terminates | Saving session state, cleanup |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | Preserving state before memory is compressed |
| `Stop` | After the agent produces each response | Pattern extraction, notifications |

`PreToolUse` hooks can block (non-zero exit stops the tool call). `PostToolUse` hooks cannot block but can warn. Hooks receive JSON on stdin.

## Context Primitives

### Tool-result clearing (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`)

| Setting | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `keep` | 4 | Retains the 4 most recent tool results |
| `exclude_tools` | `["memory"]` | Never clear memory tool results |
| Trigger | ~30K tokens of tool results | Check periodically, not every turn |

### Compaction (`compact_20260112`)

| Setting | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Trigger | 120K tokens (60% of 200K) | Aligns with SOP's 60% rule |
| Minimum | 50K tokens | Below this, compaction removes too much |

**What survives:** architecture, current task, recent decisions. **What to preserve explicitly:** current task state, file paths being edited, test results, Common Mistakes entries.

**Interaction with SOP:** 60% threshold says "wrap up and run session end checklist." With compaction, EITHER wrap up manually OR compact and continue. Compaction extends the session but risks losing detail — the manual approach is safer for complex multi-file work.

### Memory tool (`memory_20250818`)

File-backed persistent notes. The API primitive behind `docs/agent-memory.md`. For Claude Code sessions use `agent-memory.md` (git-committed). For Managed Agents API use memory stores (see `docs/guides/managed-agents-integration.md`).

### Combined impact
- Compaction alone: ~50% peak context reduction
- Clearing alone: ~48% peak context reduction
- Both together: ~70% reduction (not additive — different content)

## Reference Implementations

### a. SessionStart — auto-load context

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "cat CLAUDE.md docs/agent-memory.md 2>/dev/null; cat ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/project_resume.md 2>/dev/null; echo '--- Context loaded ---'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Automates steps 1-3 of the session start checklist. Agent still runs `git log` and reads the Backlog item manually.

### b. PreCompact / SessionEnd — checklist reminder

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'Context compaction imminent. Run session end checklist NOW: Backlog.md, feature-map.md, agent-memory.md, build plan batch log, project_resume.md. Commit docs/ with the work.'"
      }]
    }],
    "SessionEnd": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'Session ending. Verify session end checklist completed.'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

PreCompact fires before mid-session compression, giving the agent a chance to persist state before older context is lost.

### c. Pre-commit quality gate

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo \"$TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -qE 'git commit' && { git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -lE '(console\\.log|debugger|PRIVATE KEY|sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,})' 2>/dev/null && echo 'BLOCKED: debug or secret pattern detected.' && exit 1; exit 0; } || exit 0"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Catches `console.log`, `debugger`, private keys, API key patterns. Lightweight first pass — use `gitleaks`/`trufflehog` in CI for thorough scanning.

### d. Git push review

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo \"$TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -qE 'git push' && echo 'REVIEW: correct branch, tests passing, session end checklist done?' || exit 0"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Warns but does not block. Change exit code to 1 to make blocking (recommended for production branches).

### e. Post-edit type check

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo \"$TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -qE '\\.(ts|tsx)' && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20 || exit 0",
        "timeout": 30
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Swap `tsc` for `mypy`/`pyright` (Python), `cargo check` (Rust), `go vet` (Go).

### f. Learnings capture (PreCompact + Stop)

Captures ephemeral mid-session signal — surprises about the codebase, friction worth fixing, hook or skill recommendations — into `docs/agent-memory/learnings/`. Reviewed and archived by `/update-sop` Step 5. Distinct from durable decisions/gotchas: learnings are pre-decision signal that may turn into a Backlog item, a decision file, or get archived as no-longer-relevant.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'Context compaction imminent. If anything has surprised you about this codebase mid-session, write docs/agent-memory/learnings/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM_<agent-id>_<slug>.md with: (1) surprises about the codebase, (2) key learnings for future sessions, (3) hook or workflow recommendations, (4) skill recommendations. Skip if nothing noteworthy.'"
      }]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'Session ending. If this session surfaced anything surprising about the codebase that did not crystallise into a decision/gotcha file, drop a learning at docs/agent-memory/learnings/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM_<agent-id>_<slug>.md. Skip if nothing noteworthy.'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Why stdout, not `decision: block`.** PreCompact stdout injects into the post-compact session. Stop stdout injects into the next user turn if one occurs; if the session genuinely ends with no follow-up prompt, the stdout is lost. The SOP-side safety net is `/update-sop` Step 5 — captured-but-not-acted-on files (or sessions that captured nothing) are caught next time `/update-sop` reviews the folder.

The alternative — `decision: block` at Stop — has two distinct downsides. It forces an extra Claude turn after the user has signalled "I'm done", which is user-disruptive. And if the blocking hook itself triggers another Claude response that re-fires Stop, you can loop indefinitely without a `stop_hook_active` guard reading the input payload. We avoid both by staying stdout-only.

**Coexistence with other Stop hooks** (e.g. ship-sop's auto-ship-hook). Multiple entries in `.hooks.Stop[]` all fire. The learnings hook is non-blocking (exits 0 with stdout), so it never interferes with sibling Stop hooks. For the install pattern (idempotent jq-merge against an existing `.claude/settings.json`), see ship-sop's `setup.sh` — the same merge shape works for either hook. agent-sop itself does not install this hook; consumers wire the snippet above into their own settings.

**Filename and folder lifecycle:** see `docs/agent-memory/learnings/README.md`. Archived (never deleted) during `/update-sop` Step 5 per CLAUDE.md Rule 2.

**Boundary note:** the agent-sop project documents this hook pattern but does not install it. Consumers who want the capture flow wire it themselves into their own `.claude/settings.json`. The same applies to the older one-line "pattern extraction on Stop" sketch this section replaces (which prompted appends to `agent-memory.md` directly — superseded by the dedicated `learnings/` folder).

## When to Use Hooks vs Manual Checklists

| Scenario | Hook | Manual |
|----------|------|--------|
| Secret scanning before commit | Yes | No |
| Loading context at session start | Yes | Fallback |
| Reminding about session end | Yes | Always |
| Architectural decisions | No | Yes |
| First-time project setup | No | Yes |
| Type checking after edits | Yes | No |

Hooks handle mechanical. Checklists handle judgment.
